# Update TLS cert in "common" image directory to CI-node's cert.  This cert
# enables TLS/SSL to work inside the Docker build process which tunnels through
# the host OS without decryption, but must be decrypted for the STScI firewall
# to do packet inspection before continuing on to package distribution sites.
#
# This cert bundle should work anywhere enabling the same image to work inside
# and outside AWS networks.
