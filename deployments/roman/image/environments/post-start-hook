# This file is used to initialize aspects of JupyterHub which are common to both
# cloud and standalone usage.  post start actions which are unique to the cloud
# should be placed either in the config YAML or in another file so that they
# don't break the standalone/CI use case.   Only this file should be called from
# both the Dockerfile and the hub post start hook.
#
# This file implements:
#
# 1. Setup and update of the default-home-contents
#
# 2. Notebook setup for class and test notebooks.
#
# It should not implement e.g. CRDS symlink setup which is tied to EFS/cloud
# and won't work standalone.
#
# It's a good idea to keep this relatively light weight / short running.
